        and 50% reading papers and books.

        <a href="#">My paper reading backlog</a>. Expect it to grow fast but go
        at a slow pace while I do something with it.

      <p>Inner monologues.</p>
      <p>Reading classical papers on modeling human preference.</p>

      <p class="bold">Misc</p>
      <p>
        宇宙の彼方で : What is inter-personal communication, if not as modelable
        information exchanges? Even in the age of information abundance, if we
        want to transition into a new type of human, it is no longer our
        privilege to cruise along the pretense of passive data generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neural scaling law implicates an issue with the amount of data at our
        dispose, but for training models. Have we capitalized on our internal
        monologues? What would be the outcomes if we capture the alpha on this?
